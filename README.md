# MIDI2CV
Convert MIDI messages to control voltage signals for use with a modular synthesizer

###Motivation

Today, most music keyboards and synthesizers uses [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/) (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), a digital communication protocal almost universally accepted in the electronic music industry. However, before MIDI's emergence in the 1980s, analog synthesizers often used _control voltage_ (CV) signals for control (surprisingly!) and communication.

I recently started building a modular synthesizer, using the [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&VPW=1910&VPH=844) (MFOS) series of modules as a starting point, and I wanted to play it with my keyboards and the DAW (digital audio workstation) on my computer.
