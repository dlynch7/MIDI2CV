# MIDI2CV
Convert MIDI messages to control voltage signals for use with a modular synthesizer

---

###Motivation

Today, most music keyboards and synthesizers use [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/) (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), a digital communication protocal almost universally accepted in the electronic music industry. However, before MIDI's emergence in the 1980s, analog synthesizers often used _control voltage_ (CV) signals for control (surprisingly!) and communication.

I recently started building a modular synthesizer, using the [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&VPW=1910&VPH=844) (MFOS) series of modules as a starting point, and I wanted to play it with my keyboards and the DAW (digital audio workstation) on my computer. 

With a device to convert MIDI messages to CV signals, I could play my modular synth using any MIDI-capable keyboard or my computer. While using a keyboard to play the modular synth makes improvising and jamming easier and more fun, I'm especially excited about the possibilty of writing music on my computer and playing it back on the modular synth, because this will greatly expand my toolset for writing and recording music.

###Plan

This project is essentially a specialized digital-to-analog converter (DAC). While there are already many options for MIDI-to-CV conversion, I wanted to make my own converter. 

In retrospect, this was a great decision
* I learned a lot more about MIDI and about the CV method it replaced.
* I gained an appreciation for the level of complexity required to generate some very common synth sounds (like [this one](https://youtu.be/SwYN7mTi6HM)!). I also _really_ gained an appreciation for the complexity required for polyphony in synthesizers!
* Designing and building this converter gave me an opportunity to apply what I'd learned in my coursework and improve my troubleshooting skills.
